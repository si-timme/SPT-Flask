# Signal Processing Toolkit (SPT-Flask)

Welcome to **Signal Processing Toolkit (SPT-Flask)** — a web-based learning platform designed for students to explore and understand essential signal processing techniques interactively.

**GitHub Repository:** [SPT-Flask](https://github.com/sma1laga/SPT-Flask)

---

## 📚 About the Project

SPT-Flask offers a simple and intuitive web interface where users can:

- Visualize fundamental signal types (e.g., sinusoids, square waves, impulse signals)
- Apply operations like convolution, correlation, and Fourier transforms
- Experiment with signal manipulation and observe the real-time results

The goal is to provide a **practical, hands-on toolkit** to support university courses and self-learning in Signal Processing, Communications, and Electrical Engineering.


## 🔧 Built With

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (for UI)


## ✨ Features

- Interactive signal generation (time domain)
- Fourier Transform visualization (frequency domain)
- Convolution and correlation examples
- Signal filtering basics
- Downloadable plots and signal data
