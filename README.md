# Signal Processing Toolkit (SPT-Flask)

**Signal Processing Toolkit (SPT-Flask)** is an interactive, browser-based environment for exploring classic and modern DSP concepts.  The project grew from a simple plotting tool into a full learning platform with simulation and training modules.

**GitHub Repository:** [SPT-Flask](https://github.com/sma1laga/SPT-Flask)

## ðŸ“š About the Project

The application exposes a collection of blueprints that cover a broad range of signal processing topics.  Students and hobbyists can:

- Plot fundamental signals and observe the results in real time
- Perform convolutions and Fourier analysisâ€”both continuous and discrete
- Model systems using process chains or editable block diagrams
- Design filters and experiment with various modulation schemes

The goal is a **practical, hands-on toolkit** that supports university courses and self-study alike.



## ðŸ”§ Built With

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

- [PyWavelets](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/)
- [control](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/) (for Bode plots)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) â€“ responsive UI with optional dark mode
