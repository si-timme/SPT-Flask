  <h1>About Signal Processing Toolkit</h1>
  
  <p>
    The Signal Processing Toolkit is an innovative, interactive platform designed to make learning and experimenting with signal processing concepts accessible and engaging. Developed by students at Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen (FAU), our toolkit combines advanced methodologies with cutting‑edge web-based visualization tools to provide an educational experience that bridges theory with practical application.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive Modules:</strong> Explore convolution, Fourier analysis, filter design, Bode plots, modulation techniques and advanced noise reduction.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Visualization:</strong> Adjust parameters and immediately see results in time and frequency domains.</li>
    <li><strong>Process Chain & Block Diagram Tools:</strong> Build complex signal-processing chains, edit block diagrams and visualise direct‑form structures.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous and Discrete Modes:</strong> Switch between continuous‑time and discrete‑time tools such as dynamic convolution and the DFT.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio and Speech Processing:</strong> Upload audio files, design speech filters and analyse spectrograms.</li>
    <li><strong>Training and Exam Modules:</strong> Practise with guided exercises and timed assessments with detailed feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Our mission is to empower learners, educators, and professionals by demystifying complex signal processing topics. We aim to foster a deeper understanding through interactive visualization, experimentation, and real-time analysis—making advanced concepts not only more approachable but also inspiring innovation.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Team and Contributions</h2>
