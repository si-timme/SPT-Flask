  <h1>About Signal Processing Toolkit</h1>
  
  <p>
    The Signal Processing Toolkit is an innovative, interactive platform designed to make learning and experimenting with signal processing concepts accessible and engaging. Developed by students at Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen (FAU), our toolkit combines advanced methodologies with cutting‑edge web-based visualization tools to provide an educational experience that bridges theory with practical application.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive Modules:</strong> Explore complex topics such as convolution, Fourier transforms, filter design, and process chain building through hands‑on simulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Visualization:</strong> Easily adjust parameters and see immediate graphical feedback in both time and frequency domains, enhancing understanding of how each operation affects the signal.</li>
    <li><strong>Process Chain Builder:</strong> Construct custom signal processing chains with our block-based editor. Arrange operations—like differentiation, filtering, and multiplication—in a visually intuitive layout that mirrors professional tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio Processing:</strong> Upload sound files, apply a variety of filters, and visualize spectrograms, connecting theoretical insights with real-world signal processing applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Training and Exam Modules:</strong> Test your knowledge with guided exercises and timed exams. Receive detailed feedback on your performance to identify areas for improvement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Our mission is to empower learners, educators, and professionals by demystifying complex signal processing topics. We aim to foster a deeper understanding through interactive visualization, experimentation, and real-time analysis—making advanced concepts not only more approachable but also inspiring innovation.
  </p>
